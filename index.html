    <h1>Privacy Policy for LetraSoni</h1>

    <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>

    <p>
        Thank you for choosing LetraSoni! This privacy policy explains how [Your Name or Company Name] ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in connection with our mobile application, LetraSoni (the "App").
    </p>

    <p>
        Your privacy, and your child's privacy, is of the utmost importance to us. Our App is designed to provide a safe and secure educational experience.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>

    <p>
        We are committed to protecting the privacy of our youngest users. Our App is designed to collect <strong>NO personally identifiable information (PII)</strong> from its users.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not require users to create an account or provide any personal data like name, email address, or location to use the App.</li>
        <li>The App does not use any third-party analytics or advertising SDKs that would collect data about you or your child.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The only data that may be collected is non-personal, anonymous technical data for the sole purpose of app operation and improvement, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Crash reports (if the app crashes)</li>
        <li>Device type and OS version (e.g., "Android phone, OS version 14")</li>
    </ul>
     <p>
        This data is used exclusively to help us identify and fix bugs and improve the overall performance of the App. This data is always anonymous and cannot be used to identify an individual user.
    </p>


    <h3>2. How We Use Information</h3>
    <p>
        Because we collect no personal information, we do not use it for any purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
        Any non-personal, anonymous technical data collected is used strictly for internal purposes, such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Diagnosing and fixing technical problems.</li>
        <li>Improving the functionality and user experience of the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Information Sharing and Third Parties</h3>
    <p>
        We do not collect any personal information, so we do not sell, trade, or share any personal information with third parties.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Children's Privacy</h3>
    <p>
        LetraSoni is intended for children, including those under the age of 13. We are fully compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and other applicable regulations.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do <strong>not</strong> knowingly collect any personal information from children under the age of 13.</li>
        <li>The App's features are all accessible without the need for a child to input any personal data.</li>
        <li>If a parent or guardian believes that we may have inadvertently collected personal information, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:[Your Support Email Address]">[Your Support Email Address]</a>, and we will take steps to delete such information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. AI-Generated Content</h3>
    <p>
        The App uses audio content that was generated by an AI service during the development process. All audio content is stored locally within the App. The App does <strong>not</strong> send any user input, voice data, or prompts to any AI service. All interaction happens on your device.
    </p>
    
    <h3>6. Security</h3>
    <p>
        We take reasonable measures to protect the anonymous technical data collected against loss, theft, and misuse. However, please be aware that no security measures are perfect or impenetrable.
    </p>

    <h3>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h3>
    <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy within the App and on our store listing. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
